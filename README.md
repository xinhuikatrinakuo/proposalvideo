**Description**

Out of love for my cousin, I had the honor of helping my cousin’s fiancé create an unforgettable surprise proposal! This video documents the magic, joy, and love of that milestone moment, and I wanted to share it with everyone because my cousin means so much to me. Watching her reaction was priceless, and being part of this special day is something I’ll always cherish.✨
